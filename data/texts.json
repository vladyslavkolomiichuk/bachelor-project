    "content": "When I was young, I thought that boys and grown men shouldn't cry. The tears were signs of being weak. A man isn't supposed to be like that. This was even strengthened in my young mind with the popular song, Boys Don't Cry, in the early 1980s.\n\nBut just last June, I discovered that courage wasn't all about trying to keep all the pain inside. Courage wasn't all about trying to hide the tears. It was the opposite, the tears reinforced the heart's courage. And I saw this in my father.\n\nMy 18-year-old sister eloped and with it, I saw how vulnerable my father's heart was. We were used to seeing him as a strong figure and an iron-willed father. For three days after my sister eloped, he wouldn't talk. He would just sit quietly outside our house in the dark. On the fourth night, I sat beside him and asked him to tell me what he felt about everything.\n\nIt has been years since I have laid my hand on my father's shoulder as we have drifted farther while I am growing up. That night, I sensed my father trying to control his pain, and I wanted him to be able to let it out. We all cried over what had happened, except him.\n\nThe simple touch and my words \"Dad, it's not your fault\" broke my father's dam. In the darkness, he began to cry. I felt his shoulders shaking as he whispered, \"Where did I go wrong? All I ever wanted was for my children to grow up right. Why couldn't your sister wait? How can she go away with such a boy?\"\n\nI understood then why he preferred to be in the dark. By being there, he hoped to spare his family's feelings. His tears, though we didn't see them before that night, were there all the same. I saw his courage that night when my father cried with my hand on his shoulder, and understood his pain.",

    "content": "Tea drinking was common in China for nearly one thousand years before anyone in Europe had ever heard about tea. People in Britain were much slower in finding out what tea was like, mainly because tea was very expensive. It could not be bought in shops and even those people who could afford to have it sent from Holland did so only because it was a fashionable curiosity. Some of them were not sure how to use it. They thought it was a vegetable and tried cooking the leaves. Then they served them mixed with butter and salt. They soon discovered their mistake but many people used to spread the used tea leaves on bread and give them to their children as sandwiches.\n\nTea remained scarce and very expensive in England until the ships of the East India Company began to bring it direct from China early in the seventeenth century. During the next few years so much tea came into the country that the price fell and many people could afford to buy it.\n\nAt the same time people on the Continent were becoming more and more fond of tea. Until then tea had been drunk without milk in it, but one day a famous French lady named Madame de Sevigne decided to see what tea tasted like when milk was added.She found it so pleasant that she would never again drink it without milk. Because she was such a great lady her friends thought they must copy everything she did, so they also drank their tea with milk in it. Slowly this habit spread until it reached England and today only very few Britons drink tea without milk.\n\nAt first, tea was usually drunk after dinner in the evening. No one ever thought of drinking tea in the afternoon until a duchess found that a cup of tea and a piece of cake at three or four o'clock stopped her getting \"a sinking feeling\" as she called it. She invited her friends to have this new meal with her and so, tea-time was born.",

    "content": "The gift of being able to describe a face accurately is a rare one, as every experienced police officer knows to his cost. As the Lancet put it recently, \"When we try to describe faces precisely, words fail us, and we resort to identikit procedures.\"\n\nYet, according to one authority on the subject, we can each probably recognize more than 1,000 faces, the majority of which differ in fine details. This, when one comes to think of it, is a tremendous feat, though, curiously enough, little attention has been devoted to the fundamental problems of how and why we acquire this gift for recognizing and remembering faces. Is it an inborn property of our brains, or an acquired one? As so often happens, the experts tend to differ.\n\nThus, some argue that it is inborn, and that there are \"special characteristics about the brain's ability to distinguish faces\". In support of this, they note how much better we are at recognizing a face after a single encounter than we are, for example, in recognizing an individual horse. On the other hand, there are those, and they are probably in the majority, who claim that the gift is an acquired one.\n\nThe arguments in favor of this latter view, it must be confessed, are impressive. It is a habit that is acquired soon after birth. Watch, for instance, how a quite young baby recognizes his mother by sight. Granted that his other senses help - the sound, his sense of smell, the distinctive way she handles him. But of all these, sight is predominant. Formed at the very beginning of life, the ability to recognize faces quickly becomes an established habit, and one that is, essential for daily living, if not necessarily for survival. How essential and valuable it is we probably do not appreciate until we encounter people who have been deprived of the faculty.\n\nThis unfortunate inability to recognize familiar faces is known to all, but such people can often recognize individuals by their voices, their walking manners or their spectacles. With typical human ingenuity, many of these unfortunate people overcome their handicaps by recognizing other characteristic features.",

    "content": "It takes more than just practice to become an Olympian. Gold medal performances require some serious nutrition. Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape?\n\nKeri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on \"Good Morning America\" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you.\n\nCrazy Calorie Count\n\nOne secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day.\n\nAthletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished in order to train the following day.\n\nSnacking Secrets\n\nSome athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter, and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said.\n\nJonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said.\n\nFoods for Recovery\n\nWhat are the best foods to help the body recover after a rigorous (strict) competition?\n\nFor Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti, and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy, and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains, and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said.",

    "content": "A new study suggests that sad music might actually arouse positive emotions. The finding helps to explain why people enjoy listening to sad music, say Ai Kawakami and her colleagues from Tokyo University of the Arts and the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan. Ai Kawakami and her colleagues asked 44 volunteers, including both musicians and nonspecialists, to listen to two pieces of sad music and one piece of happy music. Each participant was required to use a set of keywords to rate both their perception of the music and their own emotional state.\n\nThe sad pieces of music included Glinka's La Separation in F minor and Blumenfeld's Etude Sur Mer in G minor. The happy music piece was Granados's Allegro de Concierto in G major. To control the \"happy\" effect of major key, they also played the minor key pieces in major key, and vice versa.\n\nThe researchers explained that sad music aroused contradictory emotions because the participants of the study tended to feel sad to be more tragic and less romantic than they felt themselves while listening to it.\n\n\"In general, sad music causes sadness in listeners, and sadness is regarded as an unpleasant emotion. If sad music actually arouses only unpleasant emotion, we would not listen to it,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\n\n\"Music that is believed as sad actually causes romantic emotion as well as sad emotion. And people, regardless of their musical training, experience this ambivalent emotion to listen to sad music,\" added the researchers.\n\nAlso, unlike sadness in daily life, sadness experienced through art actually feels pleasant, possibly because the latter does not cause an actual threat to our safety. This could help people to deal with their negative emotions in daily life, concluded the authors.\n\n\"Emotion experienced by music has no direct danger or harm, unlike the emotion experienced in everyday life. Therefore, we can even enjoy unpleasant emotion such as sadness. If we suffer from unpleasant emotion aroused through daily life, sad music might be helpful to negative emotion,\" they added.",

    "content": "The day after Thanksgiving is considered the first day of the holiday shopping season in the United States. It even has the name \"Black Friday\" The name comes from the idea that this is the day when store owners begin to show a profit for the year.\n\nIn the past, before calculators and computers, workers recorded the profits and losses of American businesses in special books. They used red ink to record losses. They used black ink to record profits. They used the term \"in the red\" to mean losing money. \"In the black\" meant making a profit. So \"Black Friday\" was the day when the store owners moved from being \"in the red\" to \"in the black.\"\n\nMany people consider \"Black Friday\" to be the busiest shopping day of the year. But that is probably false. Researchers say it may be the day when the largest number of people go to stores. But it is not necessarily the day when shoppers spend the largest amount of money. Some experts say Americans just want to get out of the house the day after Thanksgiving. And many stores reduce some of their prices on \"Black Friday.\"\n\nHowever, experts say that many people wait until much closer to Christmas, December 25, hoping to find even lower prices. They say the busiest day of the year in terms of the number of shoppers and sales is usually the Saturday before Christmas.\n\nA marketing services company carried out a public opinion study about shopping last month. It asked almost one thousand Americans about their gift-buying plans. One-third said they plan to go to stores to shop on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe study found that these shoppers are mainly young people, probably because older people do not want to deal with huge crowds. In fact, business leaders say many older Americans are doing their shopping at home on the computer. They say the day most people shop online is the Monday after \"Black Friday\" They even have a name for it \"Cyber Monday\".",

    "content": "Forty-three years seems like a long time to remember the name of a mere acquaintance. I have forgotten the name of an old lady, who was a customer on the paper route in my hometown when I was a twelve-year-old boy. Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget.\n\nOn a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of an old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible.\n\nI was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter. However, a few days later, when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. She still greeted me with a smile each day when I gave her the paper, but I was no longer able to act comfortably in her presence.\n\nI made up my mind that I would save my paper delivery money, and after three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window and hoped that the seven dollars would cover the cost. I put the letter through the letter slot on her door.\n\nMy soul felt lighter and I could have the freedom of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's kind eyes. The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and was able to return the warm smile that I was receiving from her. She gave me a bag of cookies. I thanked her and felt an envelope in it.\n\nWhen I opened the envelope, inside it was the seven dollars and a short note reading, \"I'm proud of you.\"",
